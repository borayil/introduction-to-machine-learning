# machinelearning
This repository contains Python code and LaTeX reports for the course `Introduction to Machine Learning`. Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented from scratch and discussed in detail, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the core concepts of each algorithm. The algorithms covered in this course are as follows:

1. Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
    + Supervised learning technique for classification
    + Prototypes derived from training data
    + Iterative optimization to minimize classification errors
2. Linear Regression
     - Supervised learning algorithm for predicting continuous outputs
      - Modeling the relationship between input features and output variable
      - Minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values
3. Cross Validation
      - Model evaluation technique to assess performance
      - Partitioning data into subsets for training and validation
      - Reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalization
4. Unsupervised Vector Quantization
      - Unsupervised learning for data compression and clustering
 5. Hierarchical Clustering and Linkage Measures
      - Unsupervised learning technique for clustering
      - Nested sequence of partitions created through hierarchical merging
      - Different linkage measures to determine cluster dissimilarity
6. Density-based clustering and outlier detection (DB-Scan and K-NN)
      - Unsupervised learning technique for clustering and detecting outliers
      - Density-based clustering with DB-Scan
      - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) for outlier detection
